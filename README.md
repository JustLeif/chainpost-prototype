## Purpose
This prototype project gave me a passing grade in my final class of my B.S. of Software Engineering from Western Governors University.

This project demonstrates knowledge of Docker, Rust, actix_web, asynchronous programming, multi-threading, HTMX, tailwind-css, containerization, back-end development, JWT authentication, and various other full-stack programming concepts.

## Key Features

### Authenticate with a Cardano Wallet
Use Lace, Yoroi, and Nami to sign a piece of data with your private keys to act as a login function! In my opinion this feature is awesome and should be more widely used in the Cardano Ecosystem. [Checkout the frontend!](./server/src/app/auth.rs) [Checkout out the backend!](./server/src/api/auth.rs)

### Create Posts
Future plans for this project include using the chainpost.social interface to create social media posts on the Cardano (and possibly future others) blockchain!
